Air Quality and Pollution Prediction
Project Overview
Air pollution is a significant concern in urban areas, posing serious threats to public health and the environment. With rising pollution levels, it is crucial to develop systems that can predict air quality and pollution levels, enabling individuals and authorities to take timely protective measures. This project aims to create a machine learning system that predicts air quality and pollution levels, providing actionable insights for mitigating the impacts of air pollution.

Problem Statement
Air pollution is a growing concern in urban areas, with adverse effects on public health and the environment. Developing an air quality and pollution prediction system using machine learning can help raise awareness, inform policy decisions, and enable citizens to take protective measures.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system capable of predicting air quality and pollution levels. The system will provide actionable insights for individuals and authorities to mitigate the impact of air pollution.

Dataset
Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains air quality measurements from various cities over a specified period. The dataset includes features such as concentrations of various pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, etc.), along with the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the AQI category (AQI_Bucket).

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

City: The city where the data was collected.
Date: The date of data collection.
PM2.5: Particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.
PM10: Particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter.
NO: Nitric oxide concentration.
NO2: Nitrogen dioxide concentration.
NOx: Nitrogen oxides concentration.
NH3: Ammonia concentration.
CO: Carbon monoxide concentration.
SO2: Sulfur dioxide concentration.
O3: Ozone concentration.
Benzene: Benzene concentration.
Toluene: Toluene concentration.
Xylene: Xylene concentration.
AQI: Air Quality Index.
AQI_Bucket: The category of AQI (Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe).
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:

Columns with more than 50% missing values were removed from the dataset.
Remaining missing values were filled using the median of each feature.
Outlier Removal:

Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and removed from the dataset to ensure a cleaner and more robust model.
Feature Scaling:

Features were scaled appropriately for certain models that require normalization.
Feature Selection:

Non-relevant columns (e.g., City, Date) were removed to focus on the features that directly impact the AQI.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing Values Analysis
A significant portion of the dataset contained missing values, especially in pollutant concentration columns. The percentage of missing values was calculated, and columns with over 50% missing data were removed. Remaining missing values were handled by imputing with the median.

Outlier Detection
Outliers were detected using the IQR method. Rows containing outliers were either removed or replaced with NaN values, and rows with any NaN values were subsequently dropped.

Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics were calculated to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution.

Data Visualization
Histograms: Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of the various pollutant concentrations.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap was used to visualize the correlation between different features in the dataset.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering steps included the selection of relevant features for modeling, removal of highly correlated features, and transformation of features for certain models (e.g., Polynomial Regression).

Modeling
Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were implemented to predict the AQI:

Simple Linear Regression:

A basic regression model using PM2.5 as the sole predictor of AQI.
Multiple Linear Regression:

A regression model that uses all selected features to predict AQI.
Polynomial Regression:

A regression model that introduces polynomial terms of the features to capture non-linear relationships.
Ridge Regression:

A regression model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
Lasso Regression:

A regression model with L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
Support Vector Regression (SVR):

A regression model that uses a kernel trick to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Decision Tree Regression:

A non-parametric model that splits the data into subsets to make predictions.
Random Forest Regression:

An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve the prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the AQI.
R-Squared (RÂ²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Results
The results from the different models were compared based on the evaluation metrics. The best-performing model was identified based on its ability to accurately predict AQI with minimal error.

Future Work
Model Optimization: Further tuning of hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
Incorporation of Additional Data: Including more features like meteorological data to improve prediction accuracy.
Real-Time Prediction: Developing a system for real-time air quality prediction.
Deployment: Deploying the model as a web application or mobile app for public use.
